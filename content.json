    "p1": "The Whitehaven apron-front kitchen sink features a streamlined and versatile farmhouse style to complement any decor. A large single basin accommodates large pots and pans, while the sloped bottom helps with draining and cleanup. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance. A standard apron front makes it easy to install on 36-inch apron-front cabinetry. The Self-Trimming design requires only a simple rough cut, overlapping the cabinet face for beautiful results.",
