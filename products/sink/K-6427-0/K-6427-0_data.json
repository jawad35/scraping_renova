The Self-Trimming design requires only a simple rough cut, overlapping the cabinet face for beautiful results. The sink is designed to fit in most standard 36-inch apron-front cabinetry. A low barrier divides the two compartments, making it easy to wash and rinse large items while still keeping the two basins separate. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Kohler K-6427 Features:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Covered under Kohler's limited lifetime warranty\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Smart Divide features a low dividing barrier that increases workspace and versatility\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Basin slopes toward drain to minimize water pooling\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Offset drain increases workspace in the sink and storage space underneath\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Includes cutout templates\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Constructed of enameled cast iron\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Undermount installation - sink will install under the countertop and requires special cabinets with an exposed front\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Sink features dual basins for versatility\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Right and center drain locations\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Coordinates with products from the Whitehaven line\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Made in America\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Kohler K-5664 Technologies and Benefits:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <strong>\n    Self-Trimming\u00ae:\n   </strong>\n   Self-Trimming\u00ae apron sinks overlap cabinet face for easy seamless installation with beautiful results.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Kohler K-6427 Specifications:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   Sink Length: 35-11/16\" (left to right)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Sink Width: 21-9/16\" (front to back)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Sink Height: 9-13/16\" (top to bottom)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Basin Dimensions (Left): 18-13/16\" L x 18-1/16\" W x 9\" D\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Basin Dimensions (Right): 10-5/16\" L x 18-1/16\" W x 9\" D\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Minimum Cabinet Size: 36\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Drain Connection: 1-1/2\"\n  </li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n"
