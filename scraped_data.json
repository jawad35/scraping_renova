Our laminate planking provides an impressively realistic wood look, with exquisite graining and knotting offering additional interest. The generous width of the planking lends an open feeling to your room so it feels more spacious.Protecting the beautiful look of the planks is a clear layer of UV-cured lacquer, which provides excellent resistance to stains, scratches, and fading, helping your floors always look clean and vibrant. A medium-density fiberboard (MDF) core and structural backer provide additional support and dimensional stability.DIY'ers will love this floor, and professionals will find it a breeze to install using the click process. You can install it on any level of your home. Mix up the planks before installation to showcase the natural variation and beauty of the flooring. We recommend laying it over approved underlayment for sound absorption and overall improved installation quality. Post-installation, maintaining your floor will involve a simple regimen of sweeping or vacuuming (with no beater bar or harsh bristles) and occasionally using Bellawood Cleaner. With regular maintenance, your new floors will stay beautiful and last for many decades to come.Remember that lighting makes all the difference!
