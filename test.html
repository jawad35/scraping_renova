    <p>Enter a world of simple splendor with our Rustic Realm Hickory waterproof laminate flooring. This floor’s inviting chocolate hue is enhanced by its authentic graining and hickory character markings, creating a natural look that blends well with country, farmhouse, and traditional design schemes. That rough-hewn charm won’t limit your design options, however, as you’ll find that Rustic Realm’s aesthetic might also be just what you need to help balance a modern, minimalistic interior.</p>
    <p>And, because it’s waterproof, you can install this lovely Rustic Realm Hickory&nbsp;with the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have a sturdy and stylish defense against any unexpected accidents. Experienced DIYers can complete this installation on their own. If you prefer, however, you can instead choose to hire professional to handle the heavy lifting. Laminate flooring must be installed over a clean, stable, flat, smooth, and dry surface. We recommend laying it over approved underlayment and moisture barrier for even better sound and thermal properties. Post-installation, maintaining your floor will involve a simple regimen of sweeping and occasional mopping for a deeper clean. With regular maintenance, your new flooring will stay beautiful for the duration of its lifetime.
