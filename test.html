    <p>Ascend to the peak of untamed beauty with our Mountain Trail Oak waterproof laminate flooring. A distinct, gray-brown hue gives this floor a relaxed reservedness that effortlessly complements the intricacies of its unique patterning. Meanwhile, its muted luster reflects just the right amount of light—allowing your interior spaces to radiate with a rejuvenating brilliance. Combined with a subtle, grainy texture, this flooring has all the elements necessary to exemplify balance between your home and the world beyond.</p>
    <p>And, because it’s waterproof, you can install this lovely laminate with the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have a sturdy and stylish defense against any unexpected accidents. Experienced DIYers can complete this installation on their own. If you prefer, however, you can instead choose to hire professional to handle the heavy lifting. Laminate flooring must be installed over a clean, stable, flat, smooth, and dry surface. We recommend laying it over approved underlayment and moisture barrier for even better sound and thermal properties. Post-installation, maintaining your floor will involve a simple regimen of sweeping and occasional mopping for a deeper clean. With regular maintenance, your new flooring will stay beautiful for the duration of its lifetime.</p>
